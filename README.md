Adafruit_MCP9808
================

This is the Adafruit MCP9808 Precision I2C Temperature sensor library

Tested and works great with the Aadafruit MCP9808 Breakout Board 
    ------> http://www.adafruit.com/products/1782

This chip uses I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to interface

MF - Add resolution support 
===========================

void write_resolution(uint8_t resolution);

tempsensor.write_resultion(1)

Resolution bits
00 = +0.5째C (tCONV = 30 ms typical)
01 = +0.25째C (tCONV = 65 ms typical)
10 = +0.125째C (tCONV = 130 ms typical)
11 = +0.0625째C (power-up default, tCONV = 250 ms typical)

uint8_t read_resolution();

Serial.println(tempsensor.read_resolution(),BIN);
